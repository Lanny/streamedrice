# Streamed Rice

Streamed Rice is a lightweight SHOUTcast (.pls) internet radio pass-though server leveraging the HTML5 audio element. You need to run Steamed Rice yourself, or find a public server, but you will be able to play arbritrary SHOUTcast streams from any modern browser.

## Quick Setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/RyanJenkins/streamedrice.git
$ cd streamedrice
$ ./streamedrice.py
```

and navigate to localhost using a modern web browser. Streamed Rice will use Tornado if it's installed.
